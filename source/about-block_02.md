# The DMTC Community and how we connect 
The Data Management Training Clearinghouse was initiated by three geoscience communities: **Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP)**, **US Geological Survey (USGS)** and **DataONE**.  Subgroups from each of those communities interested in education and training on research data management issues had created educational resources on related topics for their own researchers and data specialists who wanted to learn specific skills related to geoscience data management, but found that the learners could not find the educational resources! Determined to improve that situation, the Data Management Training Clearinghouse was launched with seed funding from the USGS Community for Data Integration.
