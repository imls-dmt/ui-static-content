# What is the DMTC?   
The Data Management Training Clearinghouse (DMTC) is a searchable registry for information about online learning resources and training materials on topics related to research data management, and data skillbuilding.  The DMTC was initiated by three geoscience communities: [Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP)](http://esipfed.org/), [US Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/data-management) and [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/).  Prior to the development of the DMTC, subgroups from each of those communities interested in education and training on research data management issues had created educational resources on related topics for their own researchers and data specialists who wanted to learn specific skills related to geoscience data management.  After the resources had been created, however, each subgroup but found that the learners they were targeting were not finding the educational resources! Determined to improve that situation, the DMTC was launched with seed funding from the [USGS Community for Data Integration (USGS CDI)](https://www2.usgs.gov/cdi).  

Originally hosted by ESIP and supported by ESIP's Data Stewardship Committee, subsequent funding has been granted by an Institute of Museum and Library Services National Leadership Grant [LG-70-18-0092-18](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0092-18) that has enabled a more broader and more diverse collection of learning resources that has moved into other scientific domains including Social Sciences, and Arts and Humanities.  Designed and developed in collaboration with ESIP, USGS CDI, and DataONE, with subsequent support from the [University of New Mexico Libraries Research Data Services](https://library.unm.edu/services/data.php) and [Knowledge Motifs LLC](http://kmotifs.com), the DMTC is available for registering, documenting, publishing, searching and assessing information about the curated learning resource collections within its inventory.

## The Communities We Target
While the DMTC started with a focus upon geoscience researchers, data specialists who work with researchers, and skills instructors, the range and diversity of the learning and teaching content registered within the DMTC has grown exponentially as the availability of quality content has increased.  In addition, the focus of content has broadened as the research data communnities in the physical sciences, social sciences, and arts and humanities have begun to recognize the need for research data management skills and capacity building for those who work with researchers throughout the research and data lifecycles.  Because of the pace of change in the research data world, sometimes you're a learner and sometimes you're a teacher.  You may need to learn a skill today that you will teach to a colleague another day.  You may have a skill that you can teach someone, and then learn something new about the skill as your "student" applies the new skill learned to a different environment, a different data format, or a different problem that needs solving.  For this reason, the DMTC recognizes two key audiences for the resources registered in the DMTC:  people who are  learning data skills (**Learners**) and those educators and trainers who are teaching data skills (**Educators & Trainers**).

### Learners
![Seeking_learners_golden-retriever-652107_1920](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5191071/123876907-0b1b7980-d8f1-11eb-8140-dfe4c2d213d5.jpg)The DMTC recognizes that learners come from different perspectives as they approach research data skillbuilding.  Some may come from a "formal" education environment that usually returns credits and degrees for the effort applied to learning data skills.  Others may come from an "informal" education framework that may supplement formal education and training or be applied to "professional development" needs desired for job-related skillbuilding and which may return a "badge" or "certification" for learners' efforts.  In either case, the intention of DMTC curators is to provide descriptive information about the resources in the DMTC that will help learners *discover* resources which may work for their needs, but also more easily and effectively *choose* which resources are fit for their purpose in learning.
