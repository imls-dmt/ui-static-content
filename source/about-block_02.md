# What is the DMTC?   
The Data Management Training Clearinghouse (DMTC) is a searchable registry for information about online learning resources and training materials on topics related to research data management, and data skillbuilding.  The DMTC was initiated by three geoscience communities: [Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP)](http://esipfed.org/), [US Geological Survey (USGS)](https://www.usgs.gov/products/data-and-tools/data-management) and [DataONE](https://www.dataone.org/).  Prior to the development of the DMTC, subgroups from each of those communities interested in education and training on research data management issues had created educational resources on related topics for their own researchers and data specialists who wanted to learn specific skills related to geoscience data management.  After the resources had been created, however, each subgroup but found that the learners they were targeting were not finding the educational resources! Determined to improve that situation, the DMTC was launched with seed funding from the [USGS Community for Data Integration (USGS CDI)](https://www2.usgs.gov/cdi).  

Originally hosted by ESIP and supported by ESIP's Data Stewardship Committee, subsequent funding has been granted by an Institute of Museum and Library Services National Leadership Grant [LG-70-18-0092-18](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-70-18-0092-18) that has enabled a more broader and more diverse collection of learning resources that has moved into other scientific domains including Social Sciences, and Arts and Humanities.  Designed and developed in collaboration with ESIP, USGS CDI, and DataONE, with subsequent support from the [University of New Mexico Libraries Research Data Services](https://library.unm.edu/services/data.php) and [Knowledge Motifs LLC](http://kmotifs.com), the DMTC is available for registering, documenting, publishing, searching and assessing information about the curated learning resource collections within its inventory.

## The Communities We Target
While the DMTC started with a focus upon geoscience researchers, data specialists who work with researchers, and skills instructors, the range and diversity of the learning and teaching content published within the DMTC has grown exponentially as the availability of quality content has increased.  In addition, the focus of content has broadened as the research data communnities in the physical sciences, social sciences, and arts and humanities have begun to recognize the need for research data management skills and capacity building for those who work with researchers throughout the research and data lifecycles.  In particular, the focus for the resources in the DMTC have been upon people who are skills learners and those who are educators and trainers.
