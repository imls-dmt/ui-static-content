Even those well into their data management careers are constant learners, and part of their responsibility as managers or leaders in an organization is to stay up to date with current trends and identify the best way to implement new practices. The DMTC has resources that specifically address this concern, as team leaders are directed towards guides on how to effectively implement “Digital Humanities skills” and practices into a workplace. Learning how to utilize E-Humanities in a workplace, for instance, can lead to better communication between team members and a more productive workplace. Likewise, having an educational reference when updating research infrastructures can help prevent future issues and dilemmas.

Recordings of past workshops and events by professionals in the field are also found in the DMTC. These events, however dated they may be, can offer insight into how the profession has evolved over time and how specific professional groups engage with DH concepts. To find out more about these resources, check out the full blog post here!
