The DMTC contains multiple courses and other educational materials on the basics of the Digital Humanities and what core concepts are needed to thrive in a related position. Many of these resources are theoretical or introductory courses offered for free by accredited institutions that offer a broad scope about what DH means and why it is important for institutions to implement it. Resources such as the course offered by the OOC DTP covers concepts like digitization, metadata, FAIR principles, and knowledge infrastructures. Built for beginners, they are a good starting point for anyone interested in learning more about the topic or delving into it themselves.

In addition to theoretical knowledge, many of the DMTC records also include lessons on coding and toolkits of the various languages used behind the scenes in Digital Humanities infrastructure, such as Python, R, or even a more niche toolkit such as MALLET.
