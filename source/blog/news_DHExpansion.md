The Digital Humanities section of the DMTC has recently seen an expansion of the number of registered records on the topic. This includes new concepts and even new media types, with the most plentiful being the addition of podcasts to the registry. These podcast records, either a single recording or a series of podcast episodes, pertain to the current (or then current) state of data management. These recordings involve data professionals in the field who share their experiences and advice for creating and implementing data management plans and projects. 

Currently, the majority of the included podcasts relate to the topic of digital preservation, which has also seen an increase in volume of records. Having a strong retention and preservation policy helps any data management scheme thrive, as maintaining records and data is at the heart of any data professionalâ€™s work. Thus, learning how to create a digital preservation program, or how select institutions are handling their own preservation programs, is worthwhile for any learner at any stage of their career.
