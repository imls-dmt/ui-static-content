## Learning Resources about Digital Humanities in the DMTC
#### by Brandon Lojek, Masters Student at Simmons University // August 2024
The Data Management Training Clearinghouse (DMTC) is a curated registry of educational resources related to data management, where the user can access learning materials on useful knowledge and skills that are highly sought after in multiple fields. Because “data management” is a broad term that finds a place in a wide variety of job positions and professions, the DMTC opts to cover many subject disciplines on data skillbuilding topics, including unconventional resources that may have practical value to a potential learner. One such area is the Digital Humanities (DH), in which I myself am personally interested given my background in History and English. As a current intern for the DMTC, I believe that engaging in these materials and working to expand the registry’s selection will better prepare me for a career in archives, special collections, or any related information science position.

While DH is itself a broad term used to cover multiple disciplines, many of these professions demand similar skills and competencies . These skills include computing literacy, digital preservation standards, documentation, formal ontologies, data curation, and even basic research skills. In recent years the demand for a digital presence on the web has grown exponentially, as companies and organizations seek a permanent shift from analog to digital preservation practices and data management. There are multiple driving forces behind this shift, though arguably the main cause is the unprecedented amount of data being shared and manipulated in today’s world. Such a high volume is transferred that, in the case of many types of companies and organizations, physical or traditional practices have become less longer viable. The humanities are not immune to this monumental change, as universities and other institutions are working to meet this growing demand by offering online undergraduate, graduate, and professional-level courses that did not exist even five years ago. However, despite these efforts it is not always apparent when and where these new offerings are made available to prospective students. That’s where the DMTC comes in to help learners find new resources.

Learning new skills and standards can be a daunting process, whether you are a budding college student trying to figure your future professional path, or a mid-career research scientist who is struggling to keep up with contemporary standards. Depending on the topic, it can be even more difficult to find relevant courses or lessons that will help bolster your resume and your data skill base. The DMTC strives to meet this need by searching for and cataloging a wide range of educational materials for a wide assortment of audiences. Although it started out as a STEM-based project, the DMTC has recently expanded its resources on topics related to DH. Many of these resources are theoretical or introductory courses offered for free by accredited institutions that offer a broad scope about what DH means and why it is important for institutions to implement it. One such resource is a course offered by the Open-Oxford-Cambridge AHRC Doctoral Training Partnership which covers core concepts of data management like digitization, metadata, FAIR principles, and knowledge infrastructures. Resources like these are intended for students who are just beginning their education in data management; however, anyone can utilize it to gain an understanding of what type of skill sets employers are actively looking for in a candidate.

In addition to these survey-type resources, the DMTC also includes multiple resources on specific skill training within Digital Humanities. These include a lesson on data discovery by the Czech Academy of Sciences as well as a unit on humanities data curation, but the DMTC also includes a wide selection of coding workshops and classes. These specific languages and toolkits are indispensable to the work of many organizations and businesses since proficiency in Python, R, or a more niche toolkit such as MALLET can be the difference maker that helps you thrive in your current or future position. Having access to educational materials on various skills and coding languages in one place is one of the chief benefits of the DMTC.

For those who might already be well into their data management career, and would not find much use in these introductory courses, there are multiple resources in the DMTC that guide team leaders on how to effectively implement DH skills and practices into a workplace. Not every institution began as a tech-savvy organization, and consequently DH professionals are needed to “modernize” and bring forth new concepts or ideas. Learning how to utilize E-Humanities in a workplace, for instance, can lead to better communication between team members and a more productive workplace. Likewise, having an educational reference when updating research infrastructures can help prevent future issues and dilemmas.

If specific skill training or theoretical courses are not what you are looking for, the DMTC also points to a few resources on events or gatherings of professionals involved in the Digital Humanities. Recording past workshops such as RDMF10 or podcasts that discuss critical topics in DH can also lead to the enrichment of a potential learner’s knowledge, especially if they are concerned with the history of the field and the progression of Digital Humanities by the year. It should be noted that the DMTC isn’t attempting to archive historical events by including these types of resources, but rather to offer resources that highlight how specific professional groups engage with DH concepts, and more importantly demonstrate what you would need to stay up to speed in this field.

As demonstrated, the DMTC offers a wide variety of educational materials in a single accessible place, with a list of controlled filters to help narrow down your search. Try out a search on the DMTC’s site now to see what type of learning you can get into as soon as today!
